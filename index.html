        <p>Something excited happened yesterday. When i back to home I was very siprised because I met my old friend Erica! I didn't see her from 5 years! (she leave at seaside). She looked for nearest gas stacion - her car was stopping, she haven't gas anymore. I helped and inviteed her to coffe and we spent nice evening.</p>

        <p>Some people could be say that studying biology  is very boring, but I think thatit depends of attitude. I enjoy study biology, but it wats preparing. Firstly I clean my room and light smelling candle, then make my favourite tea and take some sweets. Finslly I seat to desk and make colorufl and beautiful notes. With this notes, studying is more pleasant.</p>
